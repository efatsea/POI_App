#Points of Interest(POI) App

This is an app build with react-native. It contains 2 screens,
with a button in the first one to navigate in the second one. 
In the second screen there is the choice to see the POI either on the map or in a list. 

It is a partial solution. 

### It was build with expo-cli so if you like to run it, you will need 

>npm install -global expo-cli
